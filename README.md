# About Me

Hi, I’m Vagif Aliyev — a drilling engineer with 6 years of field and design experience, now integrating data science into my engineering practice to optimize drilling operations.

### 🎯 From the Rig Floor to Data-Driven Insights

With a strong foundation in drilling engineering — from well design to optimization — I’ve spent the last two years expanding my skills in data science. My mission is to bring advanced analytics into the drilling workflow to uncover hidden inefficiencies, support real-time decision-making, and contribute to safer and more efficient well delivery.

### 🧠 Blending Engineering and Data Science

To make this transition actionable and impactful, I completed several top-rated data science programs:

- **Google’s Advanced Data Analytics Certificate** – A comprehensive foundation in data wrangling, SQL, visualization, and statistical thinking.
- **Math for Data Science** – Courses by Lazy Programmer and Jose Portilla to build the calculus, linear algebra, and statistics core.
- **Machine Learning Specialization (Stanford/DeepLearning.ai)** – Practical ML techniques with a focus on real-world application.

### 🔬 What I’m Working On

I'm currently building a portfolio of drilling optimization projects, such as:
- **Dynamic MSE Analysis & Lithology Clustering (Utah FORGE Well 56-32)** – Combining high-frequency drilling data, wireline logs, and unsupervised learning to identify optimal operating windows.
- **XRD-Calibrated Lithology Interpretation** – Leveraging mineralogy data to validate log-derived cluster zones.

These projects showcase how domain knowledge can amplify the value of analytics — something I aim to bring to my next role.

## 🚀 Career Goal

I’m actively seeking opportunities in **drilling engineering** or **subsurface analytics** roles where I can apply both engineering and data science expertise. I’m especially interested in teams that value innovation, data-driven decision making, and optimization of drilling performance.
