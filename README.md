# About me

 Hi there! I'm Vagif Aliyev, a data science enthusiast from Azerbaijan with a background in the petroleum industry.

 From Drilling Engineer to Data Scientist:

 For the past 6 years, I've honed my skills as a drilling engineer. However, my passion for data and its potential to impact various fields led me to embark on a career transition to data science two years ago.

 **Building My Data Science Arsenal:**

 To equip myself for this new journey, I actively pursued several online courses, including:

* Google's Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate: This comprehensive program provided me with a strong foundation in data analysis, data warehousing, and data visualization.
* Math 0-1: Calculus for Data Science & Machine Learning by Lazy Programmer: I strengthened my mathematical base, a crucial element for data science, through this engaging course.
* Math for Data Science Masterclass from Jose Partilla: Deepening my understanding of statistical and mathematical concepts further sharpened my data science toolkit.
* Machine Learning Specialization by Stanford University and DeepLearning.ai: Acquired foundational knowledge and skills in machine learning techniques and applications.

 
**Putting Knowledge into Practice:**

 I'm not just learning; I'm actively applying my data science skills in my current role to streamline processes and optimize workflows. This hands-on experience is solidifying my knowledge and providing valuable insights for future projects.

 This is just the beginning of my data science journey. I'm eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to this exciting field!
